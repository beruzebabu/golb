- Time to First Byte (TTFB): 0.6-0.8 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: 1.1-1.4 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): 1.7-1.9 seconds

WordPress performance can vary significantly based on hosting, themes, and plugins used. With optimization, WordPress sites can achieve very fast load times.

## Squarespace

- Average load time: 2-3 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: 1.5-2 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: 2.5-3.5 seconds

Squarespace sites tend to be slower out of the box compared to optimized WordPress sites, but can be improved with optimization techniques.

## Wix

- Average load time: 2.5-4 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: 1.5-2.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: 2.5-4.5 seconds

Wix sites are often slower than other platforms, but performance has improved in recent years with optimization features.

## Ghost

- Average load time: 1-2 seconds
- Time to First Byte: 0.2-0.5 seconds
- First Contentful Paint: 0.8-1.2 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint: 1.5-2.5 seconds

It's important to note that actual performance can vary significantly based on content, images, scripts, and other factors specific to each site. Additionally, metrics like Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) are becoming increasingly important for measuring real-world performance beyond just load times. Proper optimization techniques can improve the performance of any platform.
